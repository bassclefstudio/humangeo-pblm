# Abstract

Indigenous languages face significant challenges permeating into the world of technology and the Internet. Not only are there limited numbers of speakers, but the lack of infrastructure on computers to deal with many languages, even those that do have written forms, leads many speakers to resort to learning secondary languages (often English) in order to participate on the global stage.

In this learning module, we'll be taking a look at the new technology shaping the 'localized Internet' and what solutions exist for helping indigenous languages flourish and be preserved in the digital world.

We'll find out how computers can understand forms of language, from English to 汉语 to ᐃᓄᒃᑎᑐᑦ, and what possibilities are available to make technology a benefit to indigenous languages, as opposed to a hurdle.
