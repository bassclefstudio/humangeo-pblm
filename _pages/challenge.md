# Task
Examine the approaches that individuals and organizations have taken in recent years to spread their indigenous languages on the Internet and on computers and devices.

Your task is to design a proposal for a project that would help an indigenous community preserve their language in the digital world. You may choose one of the languages featured in the resources to guide you (or any other indigenous language), or simply design it for a hypothetical indigenous language spoken in a small community (numbering ~10,000 people) who are beginning to use technology in their daily lives. This should revolve around a community-first approach, taking into account the resources for language that such a community would have and the ease with which they would be able to use your product.

## Requirements
Your project should specify the following:

 - What information/data would be needed to create the system? How would this information be collected?
 - What groups inside or outside of the community does this project serve - students? working adults? linguists and outsiders? Why is this information important to them?
 - How would you most effectively present the language's cultural and linguistic connections? How would you protect it against interference or the tests of time?

> **A brief mock-up** (drawing, slide show, or description) of the project should show why you think it's a worthwhile effort to help preserve your chosen language in this way. Keep in mind the continued cost of whatever plan you propose!

# Decision
A proposal is made by an international consortium to allow for the learning and development of AI-based translators which have been shown to allow the translation of and between indigenous languages.

Like similar technologies already used behind-the-scenes in major languages like English (see [here](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/173424?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) for an example), this would allow people to view content written in English and other major languages of the Internet in their native language. They could also use indigenous languages on their devices for things like settings, app names, and date-time localization.

The downside of this is that the project would take away funding from other efforts (like your proposed project) to preserve the language and culture at the community level. It also lessens the incentive to move existing content over to indigenous languages, if the translation does a 'good enough' job for those people who need it.

***Assuming the translation system works adequately*, are the practical benefits of translation worth the potential risks for the members of indigenous communities? Would you, as a representative for one of these communities, advocate that technology companies *divert* resources to such a project?**

In short, you choice is to either:

 - **Fund translation programs** to allow people better access to the Internet content written in English;
 - or **provide tools and resources** for people of the community to learn and spread content in their native language through digital media.

 > For the purposes of this decision, despite the benefits of both, you should try to come up with **one** path forward which you think is the *most* beneficial as a whole.
